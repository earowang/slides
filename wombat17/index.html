big data, little info.

well we can still read upward trend over time.

---

## Can we ...

--

* display calendar-related activities: time of day, day of week, day of year, and etc simultaneously?


--

* visualise such looooong historical temporal data on a limited screen space?


--

* look up the date when there's interesting pattern going on without interactivity?


--

## YES, WE CAN.

???

It addresses some questions we have

???

* Our solution to these questions is to use calendar plot.
* This calendar format should be familiar to you. Bc it appears everywhere, on
  your wall, on the desk or on your elec dev
* Here I show you the foot traffic in Feb. Clearly see the time of day, day of effect
  no particular events.

* This is only one month data. Now I just increase the time span to 16 months.
* You may soon notice there's very high traffic in the evening on one weekend in March.
* What happened to that weekend.
* Well, Adele gave a live concert at Etihad Stadium.
* How popular Adele is

???

* It's time to try this calendar display on the whole dataset, 6 years and 4 months data
* Can you imagine there are 54,000 data points you're staring at right now.
* It just shows the potential that the calendar plot handle such large amount of data and present so much info in a clear manner.

# .orange[How about residential electricity demand in Victoria?]

class: middle center

&lt;img src="figure/elec-line-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## 2010-2014 half hourly residential electricity demand

???

* This plot shows from 2010-2014 5 year half hourly residential ...

???

* Lemme just switch to the calendar display. Different story. During the summer time,
particularly in Jan, one peak in the late afternoon due to the air conditioning use.
As the temp goes up, the elec use goes up. By contrast, experienced two peaks in
the Winter, one in the morning and the other on in the night for the heater use.
* Weekday and weekend
